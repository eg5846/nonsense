# Technophile Thierry calling iRabbit International Help Desk (talking to Raj)

I tried to start my iRabbit.
It doesn't work.
I'm very tired and angry. [hungry]

Sir, if you're hungry,
I can call you back after lunch.

No, wait.
I check the rabbit. [shake]
It doesn't function.

Sir, please do not shake your iRabbit.
Press the tail to start.

I tried.
It never works.
I hate the rabbit. [ate]

Sir, your one year limited guarantee
doesn't cover chewing or biting the device.

No, I hate the rabbit. [heat]

Heating can cause fire in your house, Sir.

No, I hate the rabbit. [eat]

I understand you are a non-vegetarian, Mr Greg.
But I would personally advise you
to not eat the equipment, Sir.
